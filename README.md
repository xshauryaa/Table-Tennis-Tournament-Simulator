# Table Tennis Tournament Simulator
My personal project for CPSC 210 in the term 2024W1 is going to be a Table Tennis Tournament Simulator Application. This will allow users to enter a list of *any* number of **matches** with players of their choice, arranging them into an *opening bracket* for the **tournament**. Depending on the amount of matches entered, a tournament bracket will be designed. For example, 1 match will mean only a final, 2 will mean semi-finals and then a final, and so on. In case of multiple matches, the top 8 players (from a ranking board based on their statistics after the opening bracket) will then proceed to the *quarter-finals*, and the tournament bracket will then be simulated further until a player wins the *tournament final*.

## Who will use it?
The application can be used the following classes of users:
- **sports enthusiasts** who would like to see how a tournament between their favourites would be like.
- **pre-teens/teenagers** who are interested in the sport.
- people who are **interested in sports-based video games**.

## Why this project is of interest to me:
I have long been a follower of table tennis. Be it world championships or the Olympic Games. Back in 2019, I used to play table tennis at a competitive level as well, and was about to go for my first ever tournament when unfortunately the pandemic struck. This application is something that definitely touches my interest in the sport. Apart from that, it is also the kind of application I'd love to make as I have grown up playing a lot of sport-simulation games, and I love the genre.
